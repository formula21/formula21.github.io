# me.anweshan.online

As you know Anweshan Roy Chowdhury (a.k.a @formula21). The website (hosted by GitHub Pages) is basically a showcase itself of himself, his love of coding, etc. The website structure was taken from [w3schools.com Bootstrap Theme "Company"](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_company.asp) and has been heavily modified at post to stick to Bootstrap v4.

**`me.anweshan.online` is an `alias`of `formula21.github.io`**
